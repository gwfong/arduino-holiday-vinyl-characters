# arduino-holiday-vinyl-characters
This repo contains the Arduino code for the [Illuminating Vinyl Holiday Characters](http://www.instructables.com/id/Illuminating-Vinyl-Holiday-Characters/) project that I created and submitted to Instructables. I've built a few of these over the years and this is the latest incarnation of the Arduino code. It plays a tune (in this case, Frosty the Snowman) and flashes LEDs to the beat of the tune. Last year I built a reindeer which played Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer. By the time my kids leave the nest, I'll have an army of these little guys resting on the fireplace hearth. Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/NqEVSxMZSLM).
